# # This week we will work on :
# # Working With Strings


# # 1.   Working With Numbers
# # 2.   Getting Input From Users




# # 1.   Building a Basic Calculator
# # 2.   Mad Libs Game



































# # # Review
# # create variables for the following :
# # 1. age
# age = 25 #integer variable
# # 2. name
# name = "John" #string variable
# # 3. song
# song = "Happy Birthday" #String variable
# # 4. food
# food = "apples" #string variable
# # 5. number
# number = 24 #integer variable

# # #now include the variables you just made print in the following...


# # Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].
# # concatenation --- + around your variables
# print("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age)+ " old coder named " + name + ".") 
# print("there was a number " + str(number) + " as well ")
# print("Once there was a girl that was " + str(age) + " years old. She was " + str(number) + " last year")
# #put the age and number in a new sentence
# date_of_birth = 2021
# number2 = 123
# number3 = 123.456
# number4 = 123.33
# print("Bella was born on the year " + str(date_of_birth) + " she was counting to the numbers " + str(number2) +", " + str(number3) +", "+ str(number4))
# #create a sentence of all of this abouve
# print(f"the date of birth is {date_of_birth} and the numnber is {number2} and the number is {number3} and the number is {number4} ")

# # [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
# print(f"{name}liker to hum the song{song} while coding/ It was so annoying that their teammates would throw{food}until {name}would stop singing.")

# print(f"Still, {name} was the best coder on the team and could write {number} lines of code every day. Maybe {song} was {name}â€™s secret power?")

# # The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# # 1. Names can not start with a number.
# # 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# # 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:


# first_name
# last_name
# emailaddress
# percent
# variable_name
# zero
# list # this is a keyword in python
#you cannot use it for your own variable name
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:


# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart




# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name
# lastName
# email_address
# percentage
# variable_name
# one_variable
# email_address
# percentage
# ice

# # **Working with** **numbers** **bold text**
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.


# ##########################################################################################
# # #addition
# print(2+1)
# # #multiplication
# print(2*2)
# # #division
# print(6/2)
# # #modulo
# print(7%4) #remainder of 7 divied by 4
# # #powers
# print(2**3) # 2 to the power of 3
# # #get the max and min of a number
# print("the max of 2 and 3 is",max(2,3))
# print("the min of 2 and 3 is", min(2,3))
# #min meansw thwe lowest number

# #round a number
# print("round 3.9 is",round(3.9))
# # # absolute value
# # it will always be positive
# print("the absolute value of -3 is", 2 + 10 * 10 + 3)
# # # order of operations
# # it means do the multipliaction fist
# # then so addition

# # #to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
# from math import *    
# # #this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
# # #floor method
# print("the floor of 3.7 is", floor(3.7))
# # floor method means round down
# # #ceil method
# print("the ceil of 3.7 is",ceil(3.7))
# # ceil means round up
# # #sqrt method
# print("the floor of 7.5 is", floor(7.5))
# print("the ceil of 7.5 is",ceil(7.5))

# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# # **Getting Input from users**
# #how do we get input from users?
# # input("what is your name?")
# name = input("What is your Name?")
# print("hello", name)
# # # basic math calculator
# # #ask the user for 2 numbers
# num1 = int(input ("enter a number:"))
# num2 = int(input("enter another number:"))
# # # print out a statement where you:23
# # # add them together
# print( num1 + num2)
# # #multiply
# print( num1 * num2)
# # # find the max number
# print(max(num1,num2))
# # # find the remainder of the numbers
# print(num1% num2)
# # #round one number
# print(round(num1))


number_1 = int(input("Enter a Number:"))
number_2 = int(input("Enter another Number:"))

print(number_1 - number_2)
print(number_1 / number_2)
print(min(number_1, number_2))
print(number_1 ** 3)
print(ceil(number_2))

print(floor(number_1))
