# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
age = 25 #integer variable
# 2. name
name = "John" #string variable
# 3. song
song = "Happy Birthday" #String variable
# 4. food
food = "apples" #string variable
# 5. number
number = 24 #integer variable


# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...


# Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].
# concatenation --- + around your variables
print("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age)+ " old coder named " + name + ".") 
print("there was a number " + str(number) + " as well ")
print("Once there was a girl that was " + str(age) + " years old. She was " + str(number) + " last year")
#put the age and number in a new sentence
date_of_birth = 2021
number2 = 123
number3 = 123.456
number4 = 123.33
print("Bella was born on the year " + str(date_of_birth) + " she was counting to the numbers " + str(number2) +", " + str(number3) +", "+ str(number4))
#create a sentence of all of this abouve
print(f"the date of birth is {date_of_birth} and the numnber is {number2} and the number is {number3} and the number is {number4} ")

# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
print(f"{name}liker to hum the song{song} while coding/ It was so annoying that their teammates would throw{food}until {name}would stop singing.")

print(f"Still, {name} was the best coder on the team and could write {number} lines of code every day. Maybe {song} was {name}â€™s secret power?")

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:


# first_name
# last_name
# emailaddress
# percent
# variable_name
# zero
# list # this is a keyword in python
#you cannot use it for your own variable name
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:


# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart




# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name
# lastName
# email_address
# percentage
# variable_name
# one_variable
# email_address
# percentage
# ice
